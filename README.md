# Presnyakova-app

To run app
````bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

CI/CD made with github actions ./github/workflows

There ara two app files 
* App.js file which implemented with React hooks 
* App1.js file which implemented with class component and lifecycle hooks

For CSS for every day workflow, I like to use SCSS. But unfortunately I haven't had enough time to set up loader for webpack.
